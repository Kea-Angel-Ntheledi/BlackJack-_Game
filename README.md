# BlackJack-Game

## Project Overview:
This guide will help you set up a local development environment for coding a Blackjack game using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). You will fork the starter code from GitHub and follow along with Scrimba's Blackjack game course.

## Projext-demo: https://blackjackgamebykea.netlify.app/

## Project Brief:
By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional Blackjack game coded from scratch. This hands-on experience will enhance your understanding of JavaScript and game development concepts.

## Technologies Used:
### JavaScript: 
- The primary programming language for building the game.
### HTML: 
- For structuring the web application.
### CSS: 
- For styling the game interface.
### Git: 
- For version control.
### Visual Studio Code (VSCode): 
- The code editor used for development.
### Live Server Extension: 
- For live reloading of your project in the browser.

## Setup Instructions:
### Step 1: 
- Fork the Repository
- Navigate to the Repository: Go to the SDF05 GitHub repository.
- Fork the Repository: Click the Fork button in the top-right corner. This creates a personal copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
### Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository
- On your forked repository page, click the Code button and copy the URL under "Clone with HTTPS."
- Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and access the terminal (Terminal > New Terminal).
- Type git clone, paste the URL you copied, and press Enter. This clones the repository to your local machine.
### Step 3: Open the Project in VSCode
- Open Folder: In VSCode, go to File > Open Folder.
- Select the Project Folder: Navigate to where you cloned the repository, select the folder, and click Open. You should now see the project files in the VSCode sidebar.
### Step 4: Code Along with Scrimba
- Access the Scrimba Course: Open Scrimba's Blackjack course in your web browser.
- Follow Along: As you progress through the lessons, switch back to VSCode to apply what youâ€™ve learned to your local project files.
- Save Your Work: Regularly save your files in VSCode by pressing Ctrl + S (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + S (Mac).
### Step 5: Test Your Game Locally
- Open the HTML File: Right-click the index.html file in the VSCode sidebar and select Open with Live Server (if you have the Live Server extension installed). Alternatively, open the file in your browser by navigating to its location.
- Test the Game: Interact with your game in the browser to test its functionality. Make adjustments in VSCode as needed.
